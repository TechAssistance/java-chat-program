# java-chat-program
Old Project I made in High School where we had to build software for a "client" 

# The Ask
My end user is Ian and he wanted me todo a private chat program that has a working gui and can multi thread for an unlimited amount of users. My solution was a server program that generated a Key that the client would have to have to have the said key to connect. The server can do many other tools if its implemented but as it stands now it's just a chat host. The product will be able to keep anonymity among client to client and also have text scanning to prevent injections. The program also logs all chats on the server.

(no clue if I did ALL of that but this was my first time doing GUI code back in 2017 while still in high school)
